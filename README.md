## Database

PostgreSQL is the database for this project. I have decided to use postgreSQL to build my knowledge of relational databases. It is free to use and [links well](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#correlated-technologies) to Python which I would like to learn soon. Postgres is a general purpose object-relational database

I have created a pool in the server.ts file. Using a client only allows for one static connection.
