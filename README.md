## Database

PostgreSQL is the database for this project. I have decided to use postgreSQL to build my knowledge of relational databases. It is free to use and [links well](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#correlated-technologies) to Python which I would like to learn soon. Postgres is a general purpose object-relational database

I have created a single client instead of creating a pool to ensure ACID transcations. A pool means there are multiple clients that can be used, this is the default use of node-postgres.

## node-postgres
